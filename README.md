The Bank Management System, developed using Java and incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI), is designed to efficiently handle various tasks related to credit and debit card management. The system provides features such as adding credit and debit cards, withdrawing funds from debit cards, setting credit limits, canceling credit cards, and displaying relevant information.

The key functionalities of the system include:

Add Credit Card: This feature allows bank staff to add new credit cards for customers. It captures essential details like cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and credit limit. The information is securely stored in the system's database.

Add Debit Card: Bank employees can use this feature to add new debit cards for customers. Similar to adding credit cards, the system collects relevant information such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and associated bank account details.

Withdraw from Debit Card: This functionality enables customers to withdraw funds from their linked bank accounts using their debit cards. The system verifies the available balance and processes the withdrawal request securely.

Set Credit Limit: Bank staff can utilize this feature to modify or set credit limits for credit card accounts. It allows for adjustments based on factors like the customer's creditworthiness and the bank's policies.

Cancel Credit Card: This feature allows authorized personnel to cancel credit cards for customers. It deactivates the credit card in the system and ensures that it cannot be used for any further transactions.

Display: The system includes a display feature that provides relevant information to bank staff. This information includes cardholder details, card statuses, credit limits, and transaction histories, enabling quick and easy access to necessary data.

The system's GUI enhances the user experience by providing an intuitive interface for bank staff to perform these functions efficiently. Java's flexibility and versatility make it suitable for developing robust and user-friendly applications like the Bank Management System with credit and debit card management capabilities
